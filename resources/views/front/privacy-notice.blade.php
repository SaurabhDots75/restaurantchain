                        <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.
                            We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
                            For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A
                            persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard
                            drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following
                            Internet browser help file directions. Cookies, if used, will be used
                            on <a href="#">printit4less.com</a> to remember and recall login names, login information,

                            If users reject the cookie, they may still use <a href="#">printit4less.com</a>. The only
                            drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas.
                            Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
